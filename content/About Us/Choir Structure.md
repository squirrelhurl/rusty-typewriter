The age range for students is 8-18  (19 if your student is in high school)

**Trebel** Open to all students aged 8-12.

**Concert** This choir is for students that have a handel on the basic skills of music. They have a basic ability to sight read music and understant music notations. All students go through an audtition process.


**Why Auditions?** Every years BACHS tries to ensure that each student is placed in the right choir, thus vocal placement auditions are performed before registrations.

All high-school age students must audition as well as any student who desires to be in Concert Choir.

Students will be asked to:
* Sight read a small portion of music
* Sing scales with piano
* Sing a simple song, Happy Birthday, Amazing Grace, ect.

An audition does not guarantee the student will be placed in the concert choir.
